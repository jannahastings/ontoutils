### Library of utilities for manipulating OWL ontologies within Python 

Includes utilities for parsing ontology content from Excel spreadsheets and from diagrams drawn in LucidChart. 
Wraps some of the functionality of the [ROBOT](https://github.com/ontodev/robot) command-line interface for ease of execution. 

These utilities are being used in the development of the Behaviour Change and Addiction ontologies. 

Very preliminary state of development -- expect problems!
